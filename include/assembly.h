// Assembly umbrella header — brings together assembly-related headers
// Historically this file existed in the VEX project file. Some code includes
// "assembly.h" via the auto-generated project file; recreate it so includes
// succeed.

#include "PistonAssembly.h"
#include "IntakeAssembly.h"

// If you add other assembly headers (e.g., ClawAssembly.h), include them here.
